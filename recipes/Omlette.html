      An omelette is a classic breakfast dish that is easy to make and
      customizable to your taste. This fluffy and filling dish is perfect for a
      hearty breakfast or a quick lunch. Here's a recipe for a basic cheese
      omelette that you can easily make at home:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk or water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Swiss, or your favorite cheese)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, milk or water, salt, and black
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>In a non-stick skillet over medium heat, melt butter.</li>
      <li>
        Pour egg mixture into the skillet and let it cook undisturbed for 1-2
        minutes, until the bottom starts to set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a spatula to lift the edges of the omelette and let the uncooked egg
        flow to the bottom of the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the top of the omelette is almost set, sprinkle shredded cheese on
        one half of the omelette.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the spatula, fold the other half of the omelette over the cheese
        to create a half-moon shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the
        eggs are cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot.</li>
      <br />

        Note: You can customize this omelette by adding fillings like diced
        vegetables, cooked bacon or ham, or herbs like chives or parsley. Simply
        add the fillings to the skillet after Step 3 and cook until they are
        heated through.</em
