    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can crushed tomatoes (28 ounces)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium
        heat until browned. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and black
        pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine, and let the mixture simmer for
        10-15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, chopped parsley, and
        egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the
        bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna
        noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese
        mixture. Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the
        ricotta, and then add another layer of meat sauce. Repeat the layers,
        ending with a layer of meat sauce on top. Sprinkle the grated Parmesan
        cheese over the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove
        the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is
        melted and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
